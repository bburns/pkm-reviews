# Review

## Pros

- nice idea for task management with autosorting feature

## Cons

- still more complex than i'm looking for
- my laptop screen is kind of small for it

# Scenarios

## Task Management

Can embed Tasks within Notes by clicking the Task button on a line. Then can mark them as recurring, schedule them, etc, and they will show up in the master Tasks list, sorted by order of automatic importance.

## Time Management

## Note Taking

Has a nice text editor

## Publishing

Need Pro mode to publish, but can't do during free trial. 

## Import/Export

Currently can import from Roam, Evernote, or Markdown files. 

Can export all as Markdown files in a zipfile.
